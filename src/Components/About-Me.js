          <p>
            For the past 14 years, I have been working in the memorial masonry
            industry where I have honed my attention to detail and craftsmanship
            through to creating meaningful tributes for those who have lost
            friends and family dear to them. However, my passion for technology
            and design has led me to embark on new journey into the world of
            tech. I am mainly self taught but have recently completed a 12 week
            bootcamp put on by the Coders Guild which helped me cement the web
            development basics, since finishing I have focused mainly on the
            React framework.
